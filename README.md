# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis

Using deep learning network, we are tasked to determine which organization is worth to invest in.

### Results

#### Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
	"IS_SUCCESSFUL" is our main target 
	
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
	"APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "ASK_AMT" are the features for this model.

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
	"EIN" and "NAME" are variables that are not needed, so they are removed.


#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
